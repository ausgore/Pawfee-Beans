    "Cats are very lovely animals. They have a lot of rescued strays here which is very good. Just a pity there isnâ€™t much interaction with them such as playing with toys etc. nonetheless still have a good time with them.",
    "It was a great experience visiting the Cat cafe! My children did really enjoy touching and petting the cats. It is amazing that these feline animals are so cute that they even went  top of our  table and trying to gulp our drinks! I think for $16 for 2 hours with complementary drinks is really worth it. The place is really clean, quite and just also nice to relax.",
    "Cats here are very tame and welcoming of pets! By far the more well maintained cat cafe there is! Pretty underrated if you ask me, definitely come by if you love cats!",
    "Love the atmosphere. The cats are super cute and the staffs are very friendly and helpful. They tell us what to do and not to do with cats. They also take a good care of the cats and make sure customers are comfortable.",
    "Very lovely place. All the cats look healthy and well care for. Staff gave specific instructions on how to handle the cats. The cafe is clean and smell normal. Would love to visit again."
